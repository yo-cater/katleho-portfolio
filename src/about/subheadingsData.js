          <p>
            I’m in my final year of a BSc IT program at North-West University, where I’ve gained practical experience developing full-stack web applications and spearheaded tech initiatives as a leader of the Geekulcha Student Society. Driven by a passion for tackling real-world challenges with clean, scalable code, I thrive on collaborative learning and making meaningful contributions to any team. I’m now looking for graduate or junior developer roles—whether front-end, back-end, or in robotic process automation—where I can continue growing my skills and impact.
